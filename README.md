# Core Data Manager

Hey its another manager class to make Core Data easier to use.

I created this project to refresh on Core Data API updates over the past 2-3 years.

Nothing mind blowing at the minute. But a nice example of implimenting Core Data.

# MVVM architecture prototype

I think this MVVM approach has potential to easily port to SwiftUI. In particular thinking about viewState of a VM being a Bindable object which SwifthUI binds to. I plan to put up at a least a PR demoing this to get an idea of how challening this conversion may or may not be.
